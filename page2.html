                            <b>Health and Safety</b> is <strong>important</strong> because it protects the well being of employers, visitors and customers. Looking after <b>Health and Safety</b> makes good business sense. Workplaces which neglect health and safety risk prosecution, may lose staff, and may increase costs and reduce profitability.
                        </p>
                        <p>Health refers to our general well being. It means that we enjoy freedom from disease or infirmity and a have a sense of mental, physical and social well being. Safety is a feeling of security. We can work without fear of danger or injury. In an ideal world, we would create a working environment in which everyone enjoys protection from disease or infirmity and has a sense of well being whilst also feeling safe from accident and injury. Of course we do not live in an ideal world and, since work began, people have suffered accidents and injury at work. Our aim is a sensible and balanced approach which reduces risks and protect staff and visitors from harm. Accidents will still occur but in fact most <strong>'accidents'</strong> are the result of ill-considered actions or working practices. This is why managers and staff are both responsible for health and safety within the law.
